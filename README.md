This repository contains multiple research modules related to **multi-modal tracking**, **RGB–TIR fusion**, and **unaligned cross-modal UAV tracking**.  
Among them, our recent work:

> **“Cross-modal Fuzzy Alignment Network for Text-Aerial Person Retrieval and A Large-scale Benchmark”**  
> has been **accepted by CVPR 2026** 🎉.

This repository includes more than this single paper, but LUART and SFCATrack are important components released here.

## 📦 LasHeR-Unaligned

We also provide **LasHeR-Unaligned**, a derived benchmark based on  
[LasHeR](https://github.com/BUGPLEASEOUT/LasHeR), where spatial alignment assumptions are explicitly removed to support fair evaluation of unaligned RGBT trackers.
