This repository contains multiple research modules related to **multi-modal tracking**, **RGB–TIR fusion**, and **unaligned cross-modal UAV tracking**.  
Among them, our recent work:

> **“Cross-modal Fuzzy Alignment Network for Text-Aerial Person Retrieval and A Large-scale Benchmark”**  
> has been **accepted by CVPR 2026** 🎉.

This repository includes more than this single paper, but LUART and SFCATrack are important components released here.

## 🔔 News
- **2026.02** – Our **Cross-modal Fuzzy Alignment Network for Text-Aerial Person Retrieval and A Large-scale Benchmark** is accepted by **CVPR 2026**.   
- **2025.11** – **LUART** (1.02M dual-modality frames) dataset is available for download.  
- Additional methods and datasets will be released soon.

## 📢 Public Release
- **2026.02**, we will release the **CFAN(CVPR 2026)**
- [**LUART dataset**](https://github.com/NOP1224/Unaligned_RGBT_Tracking/blob/main/README.md#-download-links)
- [**LUART evaluation toolkit**](https://github.com/NOP1224/Unaligned_RGBT_Tracking/blob/main/README.md#-download-links)

to support reproducibility and future research on unaligned RGBT tracking.

## 📦 MUART244 Dataset (Multi-platform Unaligned RGBT Tracking)
To be coming soon....

## 📦 LUART Dataset (Unaligned UAV RGBT Tracking)

**LUART** is the first large-scale benchmark focusing on *unaligned* UAV visible–thermal tracking.  
It includes:

- **1,453** RGB–TIR sequence pairs  
- **1.02M** dual-modality frames  
- **42** object categories  
- **22** challenge attributes  
- Original UAV resolutions:  
  - RGB: **1920×1080**  
  - TIR: **640×512**

## 📦 LasHeR-Unaligned

We also provide **LasHeR-Unaligned**, a derived benchmark based on  
[LasHeR](https://github.com/BUGPLEASEOUT/LasHeR), where spatial alignment assumptions are explicitly removed to support fair evaluation of unaligned RGBT trackers.
